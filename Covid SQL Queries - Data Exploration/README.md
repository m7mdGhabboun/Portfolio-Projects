# Covid Data Exploration

This project explores global COVID-19 data through SQL-based analysis.
The goal is to uncover meaningful insights regarding cases, deaths, infections, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents.

# Description

**This project includes:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations datasets.

* Insight extraction to answer key questions such as:

1. COVID-19 death percentages per country

  2. Countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates

  3. Total global cases and total global deaths

  4. Vaccination rates per country

# Dataset

* **Source**: Kaggle

* **Format**: Excel (.xlsx)

* Contains global COVID-19 statistics including deaths, cases, population, and vaccination progress.

# Tools Used

* **SQL** for data querying, aggregation, filtering, and analysis.

# Key Insights

* **Andorra** recorded the highest infection rate relative to its population.

* The **United States** had the highest total death count, followed by **Brazil** and **Mexico**.

* **Europe** showed the highest cumulative death count among all continents.

# How to Run

* Import the dataset into your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite).

* Run the provided SQL scripts/queries to reproduce the analysis and insights.
