# Covid Dashboard

This project is a continuation of my **Covid Data Exploration** analysis.
After extracting key insights from the global COVID-19 dataset, I visualized the findings using **Tableau** to create an interactive and easy-to-understand dashboard.

The goal is to make the data more accessible by presenting it visually, helping viewers quickly understand trends, comparisons, and global impacts.

# Description

**This project focuses on:**

* Visualizing the insights derived from the *Covid Data Exploration* project

* Presenting global COVID-19 trends using interactive Tableau dashboards

* Making complex statistical results easier to interpret and explore

**Problem it solves**

Data tables and SQL outputs can be difficult to read and compare.
This dashboard solves that by providing **clear, visual, interactive** charts where users can:

* Compare countries

* Explore continents

* Identify hotspots

# Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle

* **Format:** Excel (.xlsx)

* Contains COVID-19 deaths, cases, population, and vaccination data across all countries.

*(Same dataset used in the Covid Data Exploration project.)*

# Tools Used

* **Tableau** — main visualization tool

* **Excel** — preprocessing / dataset structure

# What I Did

* Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard

* Visualized COVID-19 deaths and cases metrics

* Highlighted global comparisons and continent-level trends

# How to Run

The dashboard is available in two formats:

**1. PNG (Image)**

* Quickly preview the dashboard

* Useful for a fast look without downloading anything

* Not interactive

**2. TWBX (Tableau Packaged Workbook)**

* Download the `.twbx` file

* Open it using **Tableau Desktop**

* Fully interactive version (recommended)

This allows users to explore the data themselves by filtering countries, analyzing continents, and viewing metrics dynamically.
